# DDP2324-GitHubExercise

## Introduction
This task is designed to help you familiarise yourself with some of the fundamental features of GitHub, including forking, cloning, committing, pushing, and pull requests. By completing this exercise, you will gain practical experience in using GitHub for collaboration.

## Objective
Your task is to fork this repository, add a document with your student ID, and then create a pull request to merge your document into this main repository.

## Instructions
1. Fork this Repository:
   - Click the 'Fork' button at the top-right of this repository page on GitHub. This creates a personal copy of this repository in your account.
2. Add your Student ID Document:
    - In your forked repository, click the 'Add file' button and select 'Create new file'.
    - Name the file [IDnumber].txt (replace <IDnumber> with your actual student ID).
    - In the file, write me a message (please be kind ðŸ˜…).
    - Scroll down, add a commit message in the "Commit new file" section, and click 'Commit new file'.
3. Create a Pull Request:
    - On your forked repository's main page, click the 'Pull requests' tab and then click 'New pull request'.
    - GitHub will automatically set the base repository as the original one you forked from. Ensure the 'compare' branch is the one with your changes.
    - Click 'Create pull request', add a title and a brief description of your changes, and then click 'Create pull request' again.
